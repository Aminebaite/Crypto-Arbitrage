In this Financial Project, we'll take on the role of an analyst at a high-tech investment firm. The vice president (VP) of  department is considering arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin trades on markets across the globe, can you capitalize on simultaneous price dislocations in those markets by using the powers of Pandas?

This report summarize the analysis and include the following:
-Assumptions or discoveries that you made during the analysis
